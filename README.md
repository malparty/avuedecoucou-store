## A Vue De Coucou Store

An E-commerce solution that is NOT made for businesses!
Because some artists or artisans don't need advanced feature but can't afford the subscription and hosting fees that other e-commerce solutions require.

- [x] List items (features scaffolded from the [ðŸ“· EXIF Photo Blog](https://github.com/sambecker/exif-photo-blog) Next.js template)

Phase 1 (In Progress):

- [ ] Manage "Cart" with multiple items
- [ ] Select variants of each item

Phase 2:

- [ ] Multi-language (EN/FR)
- [ ] Display the details of each variant in a modal
