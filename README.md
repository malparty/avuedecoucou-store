## A Vue De Coucou Store

An E-commerce solution that is NOT made for businesses!
Because some artists or artisans don't need advanced feature but can't afford the subscription and hosting fees that other e-commerce solutions require.

- [x] List items (features scaffolded from the [ðŸ“· EXIF Photo Blog](https://github.com/sambecker/exif-photo-blog) Next.js template)

Phase 1 (In Progress):

- [ ] Send an "order" email for a single item, with a form asking for the customer details (no account management)
- [ ] Manage "Cart" with multiple items
- [ ] Select variants of each item

Phase 2:

- [ ] Multi-language (EN/FR)
- [ ] Display the details of each variant in a modal

## Pre-requisites

- Tool version management (we recommend mise or asdf).
- pnpm: `npm i -g pnpm`
- Vercel CLI (see https://vercel.com/docs/cli): `pnpm i -g vercel`

## Start the project

```
vercel dev
```
